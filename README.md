   Project Description:
   The simple shell program (sshell.c) is a simple text-based program that takes user input from
   
   the parent then sends that input to the child process for execution. Both the parent and
   
   child process should loop waiting on either user input (parent) or pipe input (child).
   
   The program should run until the user types ‘quit’ or ‘q’ at the command prompt.
